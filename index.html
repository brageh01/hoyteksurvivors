Between rounds, you can make strategic upgrades, carefully selecting enhancements that boost your chances of enduring the relentless onslaught. Additionally, power-ups occasionally spawn on the map, providing temporary benefits that can turn the tide of battle in your favor for each wave. This strategic layer adds depth to the gameplay, requiring not just quick reflexes but also thoughtful decision-making to overcome the escalating threats.</p>
